# VPS providers

> List of VPS providers and my experiences with them.

## Personal experiences

*Good experiences*:
* OVH, their panel is shit but the VPS's are really cheap and have unmetered bandwidth (fair use of course but I had about 60 TiB in 2 months with a Tor node and no warnings/suspensions)

*Bad experiences*:
* AWS Free Tier was not free, charged me for bandwidth even though I had a 0 cents limit set.
* MC-Node was okay I guess, they have pretty okay pricing but you have to keep in mind that it's OpenVZ. I had to find out through their Discord that my IP had been changed for no reason, however.

## Other providers

* Digital Ocean
* Vultr
* OVH(cloud)
* Prgmr
* Scaleway
* Hetzner
* Amazon AWS
* Linode/Akamai
