# Networking

Learning networking here. Got help on Matrix from @fra--:matrix.org.

# Layers

Layer 1 = Media = bits as the actaul waves & signals
Layer 2 = MAC = frame goes from MAC address A to MAC B
Layer 3 = IP = packet goes from IP address A to IP B
Layer 4 = TCP/UDP & TLS = End to end connections (Segments)
Layer 5 = Session (no more package or segment from now its data)
Layer 6 = Oresentation = HTML, JPEG etc
Layer 7 = Application = DNS, EMAIL, P2P etc

# Layer 1

The actual wavelenghts on the cable. You usually never talk about this layer.

# Layer 2

Often seen in unmanaged and cheaper managed switches.

Layer 2 just contains the MAC addresses of the sender and receiver. This way the switches know where to route the information, see ![image that shows the building blocks of mac addresses](/general-tech/networking/mac-addresses.png)
